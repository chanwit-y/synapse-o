### Settlement by Aboriginal Australians!

When I mention Australia, I guess most of you listening think about the Sydney Opera House, scuba diving around the Great Barrier Reef, or maybe sports like Australian Rules Football.

But the story of Australia begins far earlier than any European settlement.

Aboriginal Australians were the first people to call the continent home. They arrived around 50,000 to 65,000 years ago. To put this in perspective, many anthropologists and archeologists believe this is before humans were permanently living in Europe and the Americas.

I always think this is such an incredible piece of information. We have evidence of humans in Australia, tens of thousands of years before we have evidence for the spread of humans across Europe.

Just think about that journey. Around 65,000 years ago, people were still slowly moving out of Africa. They were learning to adapt to new climates and experimenting with tools or fire and survival techniques.

These early Australians likely traveled from Southeast Asia. They would have walked across land bridges. These existed during periods of lower sea levels. The sea was lower, which meant there was more land to walk across.

And although they didn't have boats like we imagined today, they would have made some short sea voyages over stretches of open water.

When they arrived in Australia, they would have found a strange land. Australia's landscape is incredibly diverse. There are dense forests, incredibly hot deserts, tropical wetlands and temperate planes.

The wildlife was probably like nothing they had ever seen before. You all know that Australia has unique animals that don't exist anywhere else. Think about kangaroos, emus, wombats, and koalas.

However, 60,000 years ago, the wildlife was even stranger. The first settlers would've seen enormous creatures that are now extinct, known as megafauna.

For example, there was the diprotodon, a marsupial similar to a wombat, but the size of a rhinoceros. Or the marsupial lion, a ferocious predator and hunter.

Australia was also home to flightless birds much, much larger than ostriches and emus. And also reptiles like the Megalania, which was a monitor lizard the size of a house.

### Life in Pre-European Australia

After arriving and spreading across the continent, Aboriginal Australians developed societies that were small but organized. People lived in semi-nomadic groups moving through the land with the seasons to follow food and water sources.

Every community had its own rules, roles and responsibilities. And the aboriginal people's spiritual life was connected to the land around them.

Central to many indigenous people's cultures were the dream time stories. These were tales that explained how the world was created, how animals and people came to exist, and how humans should live in balance with nature. These stories were myths and laws and guides and history all in one. They were passed down through songs and ceremonies and art for thousands and thousands of years.

Some people actually believe that the animals, the creatures, in some aboriginal dreamtime stories are actually based on those giant animals the first Aboriginal settlers would have encountered 60,000 years ago.

Australia's first people would have hunted kangaroos and emus and also much smaller animals. They fished in rivers and in coastal waters and gathered seeds and fruits.

They also used something called fire stick farming. This involved carefully lighting fires, which burned across the land. The fires would encourage new plant growth and also attract animals to hunt.

Aboriginal communities adapted to Australia's deserts, wetlands, tropical regions, and temperate zones. They developed tools and knowledge that allowed them to survive in some of the harshest and most diverse places on earth.

### European “Discovery”

Even though aboriginal Australians had lived on the continent for tens of thousands of years, most of the world was largely unaware of Australia.

The first recorded European contact came in the 1600s, when Dutch Explorers sailed along the Northern coast. These early visits from the Dutch were brief, and the Europeans didn't really make any settlements.

The most famous European voyage came much later, in 1770, when Captain James Cook, a British Explorer, visited the eastern coast of Australia and claimed it for Britain. Suddenly Australia became part of the British Empire's expanding map.

For aboriginal communities, European contact brought profound and devastating change. Europeans carried diseases like smallpox, which aboriginal people had absolutely no immunity to. Smallpox and other diseases caused widespread illness and death.

The European arrival also disrupted traditional ways of life. Land was taken, hunting grounds were disturbed, and cultural practices were challenged.

These first encounters sometimes led to conflicts as indigenous people defended their land and resources. Although Europeans saw Australia as largely empty or undeveloped, for the Aboriginal Australians it was their home. It was a place full of their history and their culture and their life.

The arrival of Europeans was the start of enormous changes that would, I guess, reshape or completely alter the land and the people of the land forever.

### British Colonialism

In 1788, the first permanent British settlement in Australia was established at Sydney Cove. This colony was not founded by free British people, but by convicts sent from Britain.

That's right. The British basically used Australia as a prison. The first British people who settled in Australia were people who had been imprisoned for crimes in the UK.

Life in these early British penal colonies was harsh. Australia is obviously very different from the UK and the settlers struggled with the land, the climate, and different food sources.

Over the decades, these colonies began to expand inland. Settlers cleared land for farming and they established towns.

They also began searching for resources. In the 1850s, for example, they discovered gold. The discovery of large amounts of gold in Australia brought a flood of people from all over the world. Cities grew, and Australia started to change from a distant prison colony into a very important part of the British Empire.

However, for the Aboriginal people, this period was devastating. The land that they had cared for and managed for tens of thousands of years was taken without their consent and turned into farms or mines.

Many of these communities faced violence or forced assimilation. Forced assimilation means they were forced to abandon their traditions and instead follow European culture, language and laws.

Similar things happened to indigenous people all across the world in Canada and the USA and in New Zealand and other parts of the world as well.

At the same time as this, the Australian colonies began to develop their own politics. Local governments were established. The settlers began pushing for self-rule. They wanted more control over their own affairs. Instead of being directly governed or directly ruled from Britain, they wanted self-rule.

### Independence and Federation

By the late 19th century, the British colonies in Australia had grown into well established communities. Each colony had its own government, but there was a growing sense that they should unite as one nation.

This led to the Federation of Australia in 1901 when six separate colonies joined together to form the Commonwealth of Australia. This was the birth of modern Australia as an independent nation, though it did remain part of the British empire.

The country now had a federal government and a constitution, which defined the laws and responsibilities of both the national and regional governments.

The policies of the new Australian government reflected the attitudes of the era. One of the most infamous was the White Australia policy.

Australia wanted to create a society that was mainly British, perhaps European, but mainly British in origin. This meant that from 1901 until the middle of the 20th century, Australia purposefully restricted immigration from non-European countries. This policy was only fully ended in the 1970s.

Australia also began to participate on the global stage. Its citizens fought alongside Britain in World War I and later World War II. The wars strengthened Australia's independence from Britain. Australia increasingly managed its own affairs and made decisions on its own. It no longer needed to rely on Britain.

### Development of Modern Australia

Full legal independence, however, came gradually. In 1931, the Statute of Westminster gave Australia full control over its own laws. And in 1986, the Australia Act ended nearly all remaining legal ties with Britain.

By then, Australia was fully sovereign. It was fully able to make decisions entirely for itself. It does, however, remain part of the Commonwealth and the Australian Head of State is King Charles, the same king who is King of England and King of Canada and King of New Zealand.

During the 20th century, Australia's economy and society changed dramatically. The country moved from an economy focused on farming to an urban and industrial and service-based society.

Cities like Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane grew rapidly. They began attracting people from around the world.

After World War II, Australia started to slowly accept multicultural immigration. They welcomed Europeans fleeing war torn countries, and later migrants from Asia and the Pacific.

Australia also made significant political and social progress. As the country's government and democracy matured, it introduced reforms in health and education and workers' rights. Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders also began to gain recognition.

At the same time, Australia developed a vibrant cultural life. Music, art, literature, and sports became central to Australia's identity. Australian authors became famous. And sports like rugby league and Australian rules and cricket became the symbols of Australian culture.

By the end of the 20th century, Australia had become a modern multicultural nation.

### Australia Today

So what is Australia like today?

It is one of the world's largest countries. It has a total land area of 7.7 million square kilometers, about that number. But its population is only 27 million people. In fact, most people in Australia live in one of a few cities around the coast of the country.

Places like Brisbane and Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth. There isn't really anyone living in the center of Australia.

Australia is a federal country, which means it has states with their own governments. The country has six states: New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. It also has two major territories: the Australian Capital Territory, and also the Northern Territory.

Modern Australia is deeply multicultural. As I mentioned earlier, since World War II, waves of immigrants from across the world have moved to Australia, which has increased the country's population.

Diversity is, of course, a big strength for Australia, but having a larger population also brings a lot of challenges. Cities like Sydney and Melbourne face a massive housing crisis as population growth has outpaced the supply of homes.

The Australian housing crisis is actually one of the worst in the world. The amount of people needing housing in Australia is twice the amount of available houses.

Australia's economy has shifted over the past century, as I said, to industry and services and technology, but the country's natural resources are still very important. Australia is incredibly rich in natural resources, including rare earth minerals and metals.

Politically, modern Australia is continuing to debate how to manage growth and migration, how to support indigenous communities, and how to balance economic development and the environment.

I also can't talk about Australia without talking about sports. Sports are central to everyday life in much of Australia, and the country is very culturally proud.

In fact, Australians take a lot of pride in their identity, in being Australian. A few months ago, I was in the UK watching England play Australia in a game of international rugby league at Wembley Stadium. And the stadium was full of Australians wearing their country's flag.

Australia, I think, has a typically positive national image around the world. Especially for people from the UK, Australia is often considered a dream place to live. A dream place to move to. My own brother, for example, spent around six years living across various Australian cities.

I think that understanding the history of Australia can tell you a lot about how the country has developed and why its culture is the way it is.
